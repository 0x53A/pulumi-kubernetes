# terraform-bridge/packs/

This directory contains submodules for a number of known packages using the Terraform Bridge.

This is not an authoritative set.  It is purely here to make updating those packages easier, with a single `make packs`
from the root of the repo.  After we've settled down on rapid changes to the bridge, we can remove this.
